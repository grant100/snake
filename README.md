# Snake-Game for Raspberry Pi + Unicorn Hat

Developed for Raspberry Pi 3 and Unicorn Hat (8x8).

Game grid generates up to 4 'fruit' at one time. Snake body starts as one node and grows by 1 for each fruit that is eaten. 
The game ends once the snake body intersects with itself. 
All code is developed by me (With exclusion to figlet/banner from the unicorn people).
